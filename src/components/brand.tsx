 * colour, or whether
 * the name was a title or a body run. It is one component now, so a product's
 * identity is the same object in the sidebar, on the sign-in screen and in a
 * drawer, and cannot drift between them.

 * name is read as one shape rather than as a sequence of letters, which is the
 * whole difference between a wordmark and a heading that happens to be a name.
